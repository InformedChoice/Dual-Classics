## How to Add Content to Your Books:

Edit each book's `_index.md` file in `/content/books/[book-name]/_index.md` and add these fields:

```markdown
---
title: "Book Title"
author: "Author Name"
translator: "Translator Name"
status: "in-progress"  # or "complete"
plannedChapters: 26     # total number when complete
cover: "URL to cover image"
coverColor: "#6C5CE7"   # fallback gradient color

# NEW FIELDS:
description: "One-line description for the book card"

summary: "A longer summary of the book's story and what makes this adaptation special. This appears in the 'About This Book' section. Can be multiple sentences."

whyClassic: "Explains why this book is considered a classic and why it's still relevant today. Mention historical impact, lessons learned, and influence on culture."
---
```

## Example for Anabasis:

```yaml
summary: "Follow 10,000 Greek soldiers on their incredible journey home after finding themselves stranded deep in enemy territory. When their leaders are betrayed and killed, the soldiers must work together to survive a 1,500-mile march through hostile lands. This adaptation makes Xenophon's classic adventure accessible to young readers with simple, clear language."

whyClassic: "The Anabasis has inspired military leaders and adventurers for over 2,000 years. It teaches timeless lessons about leadership, courage, and perseverance in the face of seemingly impossible odds. The story shows how ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things when they work together and refuse to give up."
```

## Example for Common Sense:

```yaml
summary: "Thomas Paine's revolutionary pamphlet that changed history! Written in plain language that everyone could understand, it convinced American colonists that independence from Britain was not only possible but necessary. This family-friendly edition presents Paine's powerful arguments for freedom and self-government in both English and Spanish."

whyClassic: "Common Sense is the most influential pamphlet in American history. Published in January 1776, it sold 500,000 copies to a population of only 2.5 million. Paine's clear, passionate writing helped ordinary people understand complex political ideas and inspired them to fight for independence. His arguments about natural rights, equality, and self-government became the foundation of American democracy."
```
