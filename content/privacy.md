We keep things simple and private:

- We do not collect personal information, create accounts, or track readers across sites.
- Preferences you set (language, text size, dark mode, pronunciation, and the reader timer) are saved only in your browser’s localStorage so they work between visits.
- If we add privacy‑friendly analytics later, it will be aggregate only (no cookies, no cross‑site tracking).
- The site is static and served from a CDN; standard server logs may include IP addresses and basic request data for security and performance.

If you have any questions, please contact us.
