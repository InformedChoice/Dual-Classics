## Early Life

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} was born into a noble but not very rich family in {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. He loved learning and poetry; his verses showed wisdom and courage. He became respected for his honesty and skill with words. {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} in his time was troubled: the rich had much land and power; the poor fell into debt, and some even had to sell themselves or their children as slaves. Anger grew, and the city was close to civil war.

## {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}}’s Rise

{{< bp >}}
The people trusted {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} to lead them. Both rich and poor hoped he would give them fairness. Some even urged him to become tyrant—a single ruler with absolute power. But {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} refused. He said tyranny was sweet at first but had no safe way down. He wanted freedom, not tyranny.

## Wars and Poetry

{{< bp >}}
Before he became lawgiver, {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} fought for {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. He led the struggle with {{< name "Megara" "MEG-ah-rah" >}} over the island of {{< name "Salamis" "SAL-ah-miss" >}}. {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} had given up the fight, but {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} wrote bold poems urging them to try again. Inspired, the Athenians followed him, they won {{< name "Salamis" "SAL-ah-miss" >}}, and {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} gained fame as a patriot and poet.

## The Disburdenment

{{< bp >}}
As lawgiver, {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}}’s first act was the {{< name "Seisachtheia" "say-sak-THEE-ah" >}}¹, or “Disburdenment.” He cancelled debts and freed those enslaved for owing money. He forbade loans on a person’s body. This gave the poor a new start. The rich were angry—they lost their security. The poor were angry too—they had wanted land divided equally. But {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} stood firm: he gave justice, not favors. Soon the city calmed, and people honored him.

## New Laws and the Constitution

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} was asked to reshape all of {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. He repealed the harsh laws of {{< name "Draco" "DRAY-ko" >}}, except for those against murder, because {{< name "Draco" "DRAY-ko" >}} had punished almost every crime with death. {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} said such severity was unfit. He divided Athenians into four classes by wealth: the richest could hold the highest offices; the middle ranks had lesser offices; the poorest could not hold office, but they could vote in the assembly and serve on juries. He also created the Council of Four Hundred to prepare business for the people’s assembly, and he gave power to courts so even the poor could challenge the mighty.

## Wisdom and Travels

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} knew his laws would displease both sides. To keep them steady, he made the people swear to obey them for ten years, then he left {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} to travel. He visited many places. In {{< name "Lydia" "LID-ee-uh" >}}, he met King {{< name "Croesus" "KREE-sus" >}}, famed for wealth. {{< name "Croesus" "KREE-sus" >}} asked who was the happiest man in the world, expecting {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} to name him. But {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} said: “Call no man happy until his life is ended well.” Later, when {{< name "Croesus" "KREE-sus" >}} lost his kingdom and faced death, he remembered {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}}’s words and was saved.

## Later Years

{{< bp >}}
While {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} was away, {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} soon quarreled again. Factions rose, and at last {{< name "Pisistratus" "pie-SIS-truh-tus" >}} seized power as tyrant. {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}}, though old, tried to resist with words and poems. He warned the Athenians not to give up freedom. He died at an advanced age, greatly honored. His ashes, it was said, were scattered on the island of {{< name "Salamis" "SAL-ah-miss" >}}, which he had won for {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}.
