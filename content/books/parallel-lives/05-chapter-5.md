## Birth and Early Life

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}} was born in {{< name "Sabine" "SAY-bine" >}} country, a land northeast of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}. He was known for wisdom and goodness even as a boy. He studied nature, honored the gods, and lived simply. When {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}}, the first king of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}, died in a strange way, the people argued about who should rule. At last, both Romans and {{< name "Sabines" "SAY-bynz" >}} agreed: {{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}} was the right man. He was forty years old when the messengers came and asked him to be king. At first, he refused. He said power brought envy and danger. But his father and friends persuaded him. They told him he could turn {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} from war to peace.
