_(Retold for Young Readers)_

## {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} Speaks

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} tells us that {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}}, the first king of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}, is a good match for {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}}, the founder of {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. Both were born in mystery, both fought great battles, both built cities, and both vanished strangely at the end of their lives.

## Birth and Early Life

{{< bp >}}
The story begins with {{< name "Aeneas" "ee-NEE-us" >}}, the Trojan hero who fled {{< name "Troy" "TROI" >}} and came to Italy. His descendants became kings of {{< name "Alba Longa" "AL-bah LON-gah" >}}, an old Latin city.

{{< bp >}}
In this line was {{< name "Numitor" "NOO-mi-tor" >}}, who was cheated of his throne by his brother {{< name "Amulius" "ah-MYOO-lee-us" >}}. {{< name "Amulius" "ah-MYOO-lee-us" >}} forced {{< name "Numitor" "NOO-mi-tor" >}}’s daughter {{< name "Rhea Silvia" "REE-ah SIL-vee-ah" >}} to serve as a Vestal Virgin (VES-tal VIR-jin)¹ so she could not marry. But she was said to be with child by {{< name "Mars" "MARZ" >}}, the god of war. She gave birth to twin boys, {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} and {{< name "Remus" "REE-mus" >}}.

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Amulius" "ah-MYOO-lee-us" >}} ordered the babies to be drowned in the river {{< name "Tiber" "TIE-ber" >}}. But the cradle floated to shore. There, a she‑wolf came and nursed the infants. Later, a shepherd named {{< name "Faustulus" "FAW-stoo-lus" >}} found them and raised them with his wife.

The twins grew strong, brave, and restless. They led bands of young men, fighting robbers and protecting shepherds. At last they learned who they truly were—the grandsons of {{< name "Numitor" "NOO-mi-tor" >}}. They killed {{< name "Amulius" "ah-MYOO-lee-us" >}}, restored their grandfather to the throne, and then set out to build a new city of their own.

## Founding of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}

{{< bp >}}
The brothers quarreled about where to build and who should rule. They agreed to ask for a sign from the gods by augury (AW-gur-ee)²—watching birds in the sky.

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Remus" "REE-mus" >}} saw six vultures first, but {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} claimed to see twelve. They argued, and in the fight, {{< name "Remus" "REE-mus" >}} was killed. Some say {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} struck him; others say {{< name "Remus" "REE-mus" >}} leapt over {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}}’s half‑built walls in mockery, and {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} killed him in anger.

{{< bp >}}
Thus {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} became the sole founder and named the city {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} after himself.

## Building the City

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} gathered people by declaring an asylum (ah-SIGH-lum)³ in the new city. All who came—runaway slaves, exiles, wanderers—were welcomed. This filled {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} with a bold but rough people.

{{< bp >}}
He divided them into tribes, and into curiae (KYUR-ee-eye)⁴ (small groups for voting and feasts). He chose one hundred leading men, called senators (SEN-ah-tors)⁵, who became the council of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}.

## The Sabine Women

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} had many men but few women. To give his people wives, {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} invited the neighboring {{< name "Sabines" "SAY-bynz" >}} to a festival. At a signal, the Romans seized the {{< name "Sabines" "SAY-bynz" >}} women and carried them off as brides.

{{< bp >}}
The {{< name "Sabines" "SAY-bynz" >}} men were furious and went to war. At first, the Romans fought alone, but soon the women themselves ran between the armies. With babies in their arms, they begged their fathers and husbands not to kill each other.

{{< bp >}}
Their courage brought peace. The {{< name "Sabines" "SAY-bynz" >}} and Romans joined into one people, and {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} ruled together with the {{< name "Sabine" "SAY-byn" >}} king {{< name "Tatius" "TAY-shus" >}}.

{{< bp >}}
Some said he was taken up to heaven by his father {{< name "Mars" "MARZ" >}} and became a god, {{< name "Quirinus" "kwee-REE-nus" >}}. Others whispered that the senators had killed him in the storm and cut his body into pieces.

The people mourned, but later a nobleman swore that {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} appeared to him, shining and taller than before. {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}}, he said, commanded the Romans to be brave and to rule the world.
