# {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}}’s Life of {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}}

_(Retold for Young Readers)_

## {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} Speaks

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} says: when we write about heroes of long ago, we step into the land of myths (miths)—old stories that are part truth, part tale. Map‑makers, when they reached unknown places, used to write things like “Here live wild beasts” or “Here is endless ice.” In the same way, we must admit when a story is more wonder than history.

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}}’s father was {{< name "Aegeus" "EE-jee-us" >}}, king of {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. His mother was {{< name "Aethra" "EE-thrah" >}}, daughter of King {{< name "Pittheus" "PIT-thee-us" >}} of {{< name "Troezen" "TROH-zen" >}}.

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Aegeus" "EE-jee-us" >}} had no children, so he asked the oracle (OR‑ah‑cul)¹ at {{< name "Delphi" "DEL-fee" >}} for advice. The oracle spoke in riddles: “Do not loosen the mouth of the wineskin until you come again to {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}.”

{{< bp >}}
King {{< name "Pittheus" "PIT-thee-us" >}} guessed what it meant and arranged for {{< name "Aegeus" "EE-jee-us" >}} to be with his daughter. Before {{< name "Aegeus" "EE-jee-us" >}} left, he placed a sword and sandals under a huge rock and told {{< name "Aethra" "EE-thrah" >}}: “If our son grows strong enough to lift this stone, let him take these things and come to {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. Then I will know he is mine.”

{{< bp >}}
When {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}} grew into a strong young man, he easily lifted the rock and took the sword and sandals. His mother begged him to go by sea—because the land road was full of bandits (BAN‑dits)² and monsters. But {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}} wanted to prove himself, like the hero {{< name "Heracles" "HER-uh-kleez" >}}. He chose the dangerous road.
