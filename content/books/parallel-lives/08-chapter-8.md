## Laws for Freedom

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} passed laws to protect Romans from tyranny: If anyone tried to make himself king, he could be killed without trial. The people had the right to appeal from a magistrate to the whole assembly. He lowered the {{< name "fasces" "FAS-seez" >}}¹, the rods and axes carried before consuls, as a sign that the people were above the rulers.
