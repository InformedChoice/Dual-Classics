## How They Were Alike

{{< bp >}}
Both men loved freedom. Both gave laws that protected citizens from tyranny. {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} gave the Athenians courts and juries. {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} gave Romans the right to appeal to the people. Both lowered the power of rulers so that ordinary citizens could share in government. Both said their laws came from justice, not from personal power.

## How They Were Different

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} was offered absolute power but refused it; he could have been tyrant, but chose instead to guide {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} with laws. {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} at first held great power, but he willingly gave it up; he turned kingship into consulship, making it lighter and fairer. He lowered the {{< name "fasces" "FAS-seez" >}}¹ before the people, showing that {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} belonged to its citizens.

## On Tyranny

{{< bp >}}
Both hated tyranny, but in different ways. {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} said a man who tried to seize power could only be punished after trial. {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} said such a man might be killed at once, without trial. So, {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} was even harsher against would‑be tyrants.

## Which Was Greater?

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} says: {{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} was wise in refusing absolute rule when it was offered. But {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} showed even greater restraint, for he already had the power of a king and chose to give it up, making {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} free. Thus both men were guardians of liberty—{{< name "Solon" "SOH-lon" >}} by setting it up in {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}, and {{< name "Publicola" "poo-BLIK-oh-lah" >}} by defending it in {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}.
