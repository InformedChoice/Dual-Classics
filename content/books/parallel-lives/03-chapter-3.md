## Founding of Cities

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}} united many towns into one great city, {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}, giving laws and festivals and sharing power.

{{< /bp >}}

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} founded a brand‑new city, {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}, giving it walls, tribes, senators, and laws.

{{< bp >}}
It is greater to create a city out of nothing, as {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} did, {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} says, than to combine cities already there, as {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}} did. But {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}}, by giving up his power and sharing rule, showed more gentleness and wisdom.

## Deeds with Women

{{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}} carried off women in several adventures: {{< name "Helen" "HEL-en" >}} when she was young, and the {{< name "Amazons" "AM-ah-zons" >}} who later invaded {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}.

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}} seized the {{< name "Sabine" "SAY-byn" >}} women, but did so not for lust but to give his people wives and to make peace through their children.

{{< bp >}}
So in this, {{< name "Romulus" "ROH-myoo-lus" >}}’s deed had more justice, and {{< name "Theseus" "THEE-see-us" >}}’s more recklessness.
