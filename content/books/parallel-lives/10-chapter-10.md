## Early Life

{{< bp >}}
As a boy, {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} was restless and bold. Other children played; he practiced speeches and imagined ruling {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. His teacher said he was “a boy who will be great—either for good or ill.” He was not wealthy, but he loved honor more than gold. From youth, he cared little for music or polite manners. Instead, he trained his tongue to persuade and his mind to plan.

## Rivalry with {{< name "Aristides" "air-iss-TYE-deez" >}}

{{< bp >}}
One of his lifelong rivals was {{< name "Aristides" "air-iss-TYE-deez" >}}, called “the Just.” Where {{< name "Aristides" "air-iss-TYE-deez" >}} was steady and fair, {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} was daring and ambitious. The two often opposed each other in politics. Yet {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} needed both—{{< name "Aristides" "air-iss-TYE-deez" >}} for honesty, {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} for vision. Their rivalry kept each sharper.

## The Navy at {{< name "Laurium" "LAH-ree-um" >}}

{{< bp >}}
When rich silver was found in the mines at {{< name "Laurium" "LAH-ree-um" >}}, many Athenians wanted to share it as private wealth. {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} convinced them to spend it on ships. He warned that {{< name "Persia" "PER-zhuh" >}} might attack again, and only a strong navy could save {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. The people agreed, and {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} built two hundred {{< name "triremes" "TRY-reemz" >}}¹. This decision would later save all {{< name "Greece" "GREESS" >}}.

## The Persian Invasion

{{< bp >}}
In 490 B.C., Persians landed at {{< name "Marathon" "MARE-ah-thon" >}}. {{< name "Miltiades" "MIL-tee-ah-deez" >}} led {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} to victory. {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} admired him, but longed for greater glory himself. Ten years later, King {{< name "Xerxes" "ZERK-seez" >}} invaded with a giant army and navy. {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} became general. He urged the Greeks to abandon land battles and fight by sea. Some disagreed, but {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} persuaded them—sometimes with trickery. He secretly told {{< name "Xerxes" "ZERK-seez" >}} the Greeks planned to flee. {{< name "Xerxes" "ZERK-seez" >}} rushed into the narrow strait at {{< name "Salamis" "SAL-ah-miss" >}}. The Greek ships, waiting, struck hard. The Persians, crowded and confused, were crushed. {{< name "Greece" "GREESS" >}} was saved.

## Cunning Against {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}

{{< bp >}}
After the war, {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} worked to make {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} strong. He built new walls around the city and fortified the harbor of {{< name "Piraeus" "pie-REE-us" >}}. The {{< name "Spartans" "SPAR-tunz" >}}, jealous, tried to stop him. They wanted {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} left weak. But {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} tricked them. While he delayed their envoys with words, the Athenians finished the walls. When the {{< name "Spartans" "SPAR-tunz" >}} protested, it was too late.

## His Character

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} was admired but also envied. He could be boastful. He once said the trophies of {{< name "Miltiades" "MIL-tee-ah-deez" >}} would not let him sleep. He liked power, wealth, and flattery. Yet he also refused bribes and used money to help {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. He was sharp‑witted. When told he would one day be forgotten, he said: “I would rather die after achieving something great, than live long in obscurity.”

## Ostracism and Exile

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} sometimes banished powerful men through {{< name "ostracism" "OSS-truh-siz-um" >}}². Even {{< name "Aristides" "air-iss-TYE-deez" >}} had once been sent away. At last, {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} too was ostracized. Later, his enemies accused him of treason, claiming he secretly plotted with {{< name "Persia" "PER-zhuh" >}}. The {{< name "Spartans" "SPAR-tunz" >}} pressed the charge. {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} fled from city to city—first to {{< name "Corcyra" "KOR-sih-rah" >}}, then to {{< name "Epirus" "eh-PEER-us" >}}, then across the sea. At last he reached Asia and sought refuge with King {{< name "Artaxerxes" "ar-tak-SERK-seez" >}} of {{< name "Persia" "PER-zhuh" >}}—the very king he had once defeated.

## Life in {{< name "Persia" "PER-zhuh" >}}

{{< bp >}}
The Persian king welcomed him with honor. He gave him cities, lands, and riches: • {{< name "Magnesia" "mag-NEE-zhuh" >}} for bread, • {{< name "Lampsacus" "lamp-SAY-kus" >}} for wine, • {{< name "Myus" "MY-us" >}} for meat. {{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} lived as a Persian noble, far from {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. Yet he never forgot his homeland. When asked to lead Persian armies against {{< name "Greece" "GREESS" >}}, some say he chose to die instead—drinking poison rather than betray {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}}. Others say he died peacefully of sickness.

## Closing

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Themistocles" "thuh-MIS-toh-kleez" >}} rose from restless youth to savior of {{< name "Greece" "GREESS" >}}. He built the Athenian navy, won at {{< name "Salamis" "SAL-ah-miss" >}}, and secured {{< name "Athens" "ATH-ens" >}} with walls and harbors. But envy and ambition led to exile. He shows us both the greatness and the dangers of bold ambition—how one man can save a city, yet still be cast aside by it.
