# {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}}’s Life of {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}}

_(Retold for Young Readers)_

## {{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} Speaks

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Plutarch" "PLOO-tark" >}} tells us that {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}}, the lawgiver of {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}, can be compared with {{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}}, the lawgiver of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}. Both were remembered for giving laws, not for conquering lands. But {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} made his people hard and warlike, while {{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}} made his people gentle and peaceful.

## Birth and Early Life

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} was said to be a descendant of {{< name "Heracles" "HER-uh-kleez" >}}. His family ruled in {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}, a city in Greece famous for its warriors. When the king, his brother, died, the throne should have gone to the king’s young son. Until that boy grew up, {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} served as guardian of both the boy and the kingdom. Some people whispered that {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} wanted the throne for himself. To avoid suspicion, he left {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}} and traveled far away.

## Travels and Learning

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} went first to {{< name "Crete" "KREET" >}}, where he studied their laws and customs. He met wise men like {{< name "Thales" "THAY-leez" >}}, who taught through songs and poetry but really gave political advice. From {{< name "Crete" "KREET" >}} he sailed to Asia Minor and studied the wealth and luxury of the {{< name "Ionians" "eye-OH-nee-anz" >}}. He disliked their soft living. Later he even visited Egypt and, some say, even India, always learning how other nations lived and governed.

## Return to {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}

{{< bp >}}
When {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} returned, he brought bold new ideas. {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}} was troubled by quarrels and greed. Rich men had too much, poor men too little. {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} wanted to make all Spartans equal. First he divided the land into equal lots—nine thousand for Spartan citizens and thirty thousand for the surrounding free people, called {{< name "Perioeci" "PAIR-ee-oh-sigh" >}}. Each piece of land gave just enough grain, oil, and wine to support a family. He also took away gold and silver money. Instead, he made heavy iron bars the only money. They were so bulky that no one could carry much, and thieves had nothing worth stealing. This change ended greed for riches.

## Simple Living

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} wanted no fancy furniture, no silver cups, no gold jewelry. He ordered all to eat at common meals, called {{< name "syssitia" "sis-SIT-ee-uhs" >}}¹. Men and boys ate together in groups. Everyone had plain food—mostly barley, black broth, cheese, and little meat. Guests could be invited, but not often. He even made the women exercise—running, wrestling, and throwing the discus—so they would be strong mothers of strong children. Marriage, too, was carefully arranged, and men were not allowed to marry too late in life.

## Raising Children

{{< bp >}}
In {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}, children belonged to the city as much as to their parents. When a baby was born, elders inspected it. If the child was healthy, it was raised; if weak, it was sadly left to die on a hillside. Boys were trained from seven years old in groups. They lived in barracks, went barefoot, wore one cloak all year, and slept on reeds. They learned to endure hunger, pain, and hardship. To sharpen their wits, they were encouraged to speak briefly and wisely—this became known as “{{< name "Laconic" "la-KON-ik" >}}”² speech.

## Laws and Government

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} also re‑shaped {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}}’s government. He created a council of elders, called the {{< name "Gerousia" "geh-ROO-see-uh" >}}³, made up of wise men over sixty. He balanced power between the kings, the council, and the people’s assembly. Later, {{< name "ephors" "EH-fors" >}}⁴, a board of five overseers, were added. To make the laws respected, he said they came from the god {{< name "Apollo" "ah-PAH-loh" >}} at {{< name "Delphi" "DEL-fee" >}}. People called them {{< name "rhetras" "RAY-trahs" >}}⁵—divine commands.

## Lasting Peace at Home

{{< bp >}}
When {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} saw his reforms were accepted, he bound the people by an oath not to change anything until he returned. Then he went on a journey, never to come back. Some say he died in {{< name "Crete" "KREET" >}}, others in {{< name "Delphi" "DEL-fee" >}}. His body, they say, was burned and the ashes scattered into the sea, so Spartans could not claim he had returned and break their oath.

His people became fearless warriors, living simply, speaking wisely, and putting the city above themselves. Though he died far away, his laws lived on for centuries, making {{< name "Sparta" "SPAR-tuh" >}} one of the most admired—and feared—cities of Greece.
