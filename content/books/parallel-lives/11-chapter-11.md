## The War with {{< name "Veii" "VAY-ee" >}}²

{{< bp >}}
The Etruscan city of {{< name "Veii" "VAY-ee" >}}² was a strong enemy of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}. The Romans besieged it for ten years, just as the Greeks had once besieged {{< name "Troy" "TROI" >}}. {{< name "Camillus" "cuh-MIL-us" >}} was chosen {{< name "dictator" "dik-TAY-tor" >}}¹—a supreme commander in crisis. He prayed to the goddess {{< name "Juno" "JOO-noh" >}}, promising to bring her statue from {{< name "Veii" "VAY-ee" >}} to {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} if he was victorious. Then, by digging tunnels under the walls, the Romans stormed the city. {{< name "Camillus" "cuh-MIL-us" >}} triumphed and carried {{< name "Juno" "JOO-noh" >}}’s statue to {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}, where it was said to have willingly accepted its new home.

{{< bp >}}
This great victory doubled {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}’s size and power. {{< name "Camillus" "cuh-MIL-us" >}} celebrated a splendid triumph, riding in a chariot drawn by four white horses. Some thought this too proud—like a king instead of a citizen.

## The Gauls Attack

{{< bp >}}
Not long after, the Gauls under {{< name "Brennus" "BREN-nus" >}} invaded Italy. They crushed the Romans at the river {{< name "Allia" "AL-ee-ah" >}}³. Most citizens fled, and the Gauls marched into {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}. The old senators sat calmly in their ivory chairs, awaiting death. The sacred geese of {{< name "Juno" "JOO-noh" >}} warned the defenders on the {{< name "Capitol" "KAP-ih-tol" >}}⁴ when the Gauls tried a night assault—one goose honked so loudly it saved the citadel. At last, {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} was starving. The Romans agreed to pay ransom: a thousand pounds of gold. As they weighed it out, {{< name "Brennus" "BREN-nus" >}} threw his sword on the scale, crying, “Woe to the vanquished!”

## {{< name "Camillus" "cuh-MIL-us" >}} Returns

{{< bp >}}
But before the ransom was paid, {{< name "Camillus" "cuh-MIL-us" >}}—recalled from exile—arrived with an army. He forbade the ransom, declaring: “{{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} is to be ransomed with steel, not with gold!” He fought the Gauls, defeated them, and drove them from the city. Thus he became the “Second Founder of {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}}.”

When new quarrels rose between {{< name "patricians" "puh-TRISH-unz" >}} (the nobles) and {{< name "plebeians" "plih-BEE-enz" >}} (the common people), he often acted as mediator.

Both knew the glory of saving a city—and the pain of exile from their own people.
