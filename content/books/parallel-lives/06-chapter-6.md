## How They Were Alike

Both men were famous not for conquering lands, but for shaping their people with laws. Both made their citizens live with discipline.

## How They Were Different

{{< bp >}}
But they were not the same in spirit. {{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} trained his people to be soldiers. His laws made Spartans hard, brave, and ready for war. He took away wealth, forced all to live simply, and raised boys to endure pain and hunger. {{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}}, instead, taught peace. He stopped wars, built temples, and filled {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} with sacred rites. He turned fiery warriors into gentle worshippers, teaching them to honor the gods with prayer and sacrifice.

## Different Kinds of Kingship

{{< bp >}}
{{< name "Lycurgus" "lye-KUR-gus" >}} ruled first as a guardian, then gave his city laws, and finally left so they would keep them. He used force at times, even risking his life, but he created a system where rich and poor were equal. {{< name "Numa" "NOO-muh" >}} ruled as a king by choice of the people. He never used force. His power rested on persuasion and religion. He made {{< name "Rome" "ROHM" >}} just and peaceful without fighting or bloodshed.
