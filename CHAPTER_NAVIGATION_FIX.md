# Chapter Navigation - Fixed and Improved

## The Issue
The Next button was already there! But on mobile screens, the Previous and Next buttons were stacking vertically (one on top of the other), making the Next button less visible - users had to scroll down to see it.

## The Solution
I've improved the chapter navigation to be more mobile-friendly:

### What Changed:
1. **Side-by-side on mobile**: Previous and Next buttons now stay side-by-side on mobile screens (down to 600px width)
2. **Visual arrows**: Added ← and → icons to make navigation direction instantly clear
3. **Compact design**: Buttons are smaller on mobile but still easy to tap
4. **Smart stacking**: Only stacks vertically on very tiny screens (under 350px)

### Files Modified:
- Created `/static/css/chapter-navigation.css` - New CSS for improved navigation
- Updated `/themes/dualkids/layouts/_default/baseof.html` - Added link to new CSS file

### Visual Improvements:
- **Desktop**: Full-size buttons with chapter titles visible
- **Mobile**: Compact buttons, side-by-side, with arrows
- **Tiny screens**: Gracefully stacks when truly necessary

## Testing
Open `test-chapter-navigation.html` in your browser to see:
- How it looks on different screen sizes
- Interactive viewport simulator
- Edge cases (first chapter, last chapter)

## Benefits
✅ Both navigation buttons always visible
✅ Clear directional indicators (arrows)
✅ Mobile-optimized without sacrificing usability
✅ Works great on phones, tablets, and desktops
✅ No JavaScript needed - pure CSS solution

## How It Looks
```
[← Previous: Chapter 18]  [Next: Chapter 20 →]
        [▼ Jump to chapter...]
```

The navigation is now much clearer on small screens!
