# Chapter Navigation Fix - Complete! ✅

## Problem Solved:
The chapter navigation was showing incorrect Previous/Next labels and chapters. The issue was with how Hugo's `.PrevInSection` and `.NextInSection` work - they don't respect the `weight` parameter properly for chapter ordering.

## Solution:
1. **Fixed Navigation Logic**: Now uses `.Parent.Pages.ByWeight` to get chapters in correct order
2. **Finds Current Position**: Locates current chapter's index in the sorted list
3. **Calculates Prev/Next**: Properly determines previous and next chapters based on weight order

## Visual Improvements:
- **First Chapter**: Shows "This is the first chapter" instead of empty space
- **Last Chapter**: Shows "You've reached the end!" with celebration
- **Added Arrows**: ← Previous and Next → for better visual direction
- **Disabled State**: Greyed out styling for unavailable navigation
- **Hover Effects**: Only active links have hover animations

## Files Modified:
- `/themes/dualkids/layouts/books/single.html` - Fixed navigation logic
- `/themes/dualkids/assets/css/main.css` - Added disabled state styles

## How It Works:
```
Chapter 1: [Disabled Previous] [Next → Chapter 2]
Chapter 2: [← Previous Chapter 1] [Next → Chapter 3]
Chapter 3: [← Previous Chapter 2] [Disabled Next - End]
```

The navigation now correctly respects chapter order and provides helpful feedback at the beginning and end of books!
