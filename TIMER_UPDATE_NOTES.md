# Timer and Settings Panel Improvements - Complete! ‚úÖ

## What I Fixed:

### 1. **Timer Panel** üéØ
- **Better Mobile Layout**: Optimized for phones and iPads with a clean, card-like design

  - Rounded corners and smooth animations
  - Clear, large display with monospace font for easy reading
  - Color-coded buttons (orange for Start, gray for Pause, etc.)
  - Animated pulse effect when timer is running
- **Two Modes**: 
  - Countdown Timer (set minutes, counts down)
  - Stopwatch (counts up indefinitely)
- **Features**:
  - Sound notification when countdown completes
  - Daily reading time tracker
  - Remembers settings between sessions
  - Auto-pauses when page is hidden

### 2. **Settings Panel** üé®
- **Mobile-First Design**: 
  - On phones: Slides up from bottom with smooth animation
  - On desktop: Appears below the top navigation
- **Fixed Border Issues**: All controls now stay within proper boundaries

### 3. **Key Features Added**:
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Esc` - Close any open panel
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + ,` - Toggle settings panel
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + T` - Toggle timer panel

## How to Test:

1. **Start your Hugo server**: 
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chrisrodgers/Projects/Dual-Classics
   hugo server -D
   ```

2. **Open a book chapter** and look for:
   - Settings button (gear icon) in top-right
   - Timer button in the settings panel

3. **Test the Timer**:
   - Click "‚è± Show Timer" in settings panel
   - Try both Countdown and Stopwatch modes
   - Set different minute values (1-120 minutes)
   - Test the sound with the bell button üîî

4. **Test on Mobile**:
   - Use browser dev tools to simulate iPhone/iPad
   - Check that panels slide properly
   - Verify touch targets are easy to tap

## Visual Highlights:

### Timer Panel:
- **Position**: Fixed at bottom of screen, centered
- **Colors**: Orange accent (#ff9944) matching your site theme
- **Display**: Large, clear numbers (2.5rem on desktop, 2rem on mobile)
- **Animation**: Gentle pulse when running

### Settings Panel:

## Files Modified:
